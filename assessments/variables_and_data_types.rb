## Assessment 1: Basic Variable Declaration and Usage
##   1. Declare two variables, `name` and `age`, and assign them your name and age.
##   2. Print out a message using these variables: "My name is [name], I'm learning Ruby! And I am [age] years old."


## Assessment 2: Difference between String and Symbol
##   1. Declare two constant strings and give them the same value.
##   2. Declare two symbols and give them the same value.
##   3. Compare


## Assessment 3: Numeric Operations and Conversions
##   1. Declare a variable `int_number` with an integer value.
##   2. Declare another variable `float_number` with a floating-point value.
##   3. Perform the following operations:
##     - Add `int_number` and `float_number`.
##     - Substract `float_number` from `int_number`
##     - Multiply `int_number` by 2.
##     - Divide `float_number` by 3.
##   4. Print the results of each operation.


## Assessment 4: Numeric Operations and Conversions
##   1. Declare a variable `int_number` with an integer value.
##   2. Declare another variable `float_number` with a floating-point value.
##   3. Perform the following operations:
##     - Add `int_number` and `float_number`.
##     - Substract `float_number` from `int_number`
##     - Multiply `int_number` by 2.
##     - Divide `float_number` by 3.
##   4. Print the results of each operation.


## Assessment 5: Working with Arrays.
##   1. Create an array named `fruits` containing the following fruits: "apple", "banana", "orange", "grape", "watermelon".
##   2. Add "strawberry" to the end of the array.
##   3. Remove the second fruit from the array.
##   4. Print out the mmodified `fruits` array.
##   5. Print only the third fruit in the array.


## Assessment 6: More Array Operations
##   1. Create an array called `numbers` containing the numbers 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25.
##   2. Calculate the sum of all the numbers in the `numbers` array.
##   3. Calculate the product of the first and last numbers in the array.
##   4. Replace the third number with its square.
##   5. Print out the modified `numbers` array.


## Assessment 7: Hash Basics
##   1. Create an empty hash called `person`
##   2. Add the following key-value pairs to the `person` hash and assign values:
##     - `"name"`
##     - `"age"`
##   3. Print out the `person`hash


## Assessment 8: Hash Operations
##   1. Create a hash called `book` with the following key-value pairs:
##     - `"title"`
##     - `"author"`
##     - `"year"`
##   2. Add a key-value pair `"genre"` with the value of the book's genre to the `book` hash.
##   3. Create a sub-hash from the `book` hash called `book_preview` containing only the title and author.
##   4. Print out over the `book` hash and `book_preview` and print each key and its corresponding value.


## Assessment 9: Nested Hashes
##   1. Create a hash called `library` with two key-value pairs:
##     - `"name"`
##     - `"books"`
##     ** Note: `books` must have an array with one hash item with the key-value pairs:
##       - `"title"`
##       - `"author"`
##       - `"year"`
##   2. Add an additional book to the `books` array.
##   3. Print out the name of the library and the titles of all the books in the library.


## Assessment 10: Conditional Statements and Boolean Logic
##   1. Declare a variable `temperature` and assign it a value representing the current temperature in Celsius.
##   2. Using an if-else statement, declare the following:
##     - If `temperature` is less than 0, print "it's freezing!"
##     - If `temperature` is between 0 and 20 (inclusive), print "It's cold."
##     - If `temperature` is between 21 and 30 (inclusive), print "It's comfortable."
##     - If `temperature` is above 30, print "It's hot!"
##   3. Test the code with different `temperature` values.
